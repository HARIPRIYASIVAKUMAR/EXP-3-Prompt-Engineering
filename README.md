# EXP-3-PROMPT-ENGINEERING-

## Aim: 
Evaluation of 2024 Prompting Tools Across Diverse AI Platforms: 
ChatGPT, Claude, Bard, Cohere Command, and Meta
Experiment:
Within a specific use case (e.g., summarizing text, answering technical questions), compare the performance, user experience, and response quality of prompting tools across these different AI platforms.

## Algorithm:
Step 1 : Analyze the prompt to define the report's topic, scope, and requirements.

Step 2 : Create a detailed, multi-section outline to structure the report's content.

Step 3 : Synthesize key information for each platform and use case.

Step 4 : Generate each report section sequentially, from the introduction to the conclusion.

Step 5 : Formulate prompts to create relevant images for each section.

Step 6 : Interleave the generated images within the report's text.

Step 7 : Review and refine the complete report to ensure it meets all instructions
## Prompt
Generate a detailed 20-page report titled “Evaluation of 2024 Prompting Tools Across Diverse AI Platforms: ChatGPT, Claude, Bard, Cohere Command, and Meta Experiment.” The report should focus on two key use cases: long-document summarization and technical question answering. Compare the platforms on performance, user experience, and response quality. For each platform, discuss prompting capabilities, strengths and weaknesses, and include example prompt templates like system prompts, few-shot, chain prompts, and retrieval-augmented prompts. Provide qualitative scoring on correctness, coherence, instruction-following, long-context handling, developer experience, and safety. Use a professional, academic tone with clear sections such as Executive Summary, Methodology, Platform Analyses, Comparative Experiments, Recommendations, and Appendices. End with best practices and insights on the maturity of prompt engineering in 2024.

## Result
The 2024 AI market is defined by a fierce competition for specialization and user experience. ChatGPT remains the most versatile and user-friendly platform for general tasks. Claude is the king of long-form analysis and complex reasoning. Google Gemini is the fastest and most relevant for up-to-the-minute information. Cohere Command is the most trustworthy for fact-based, enterprise-level tasks. Finally, Meta AI excels at casual, conversational use within a social ecosystem. The ultimate "winner" is not a single platform but the informed user who understands how to select the right tool for the job.
